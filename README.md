This project analyzes a synthetic retail dataset from Kaggle that simulates product orders placed by hotel properties across the United States between 2015 and 2016. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights through data cleaning, merging, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The dataset includes three key tables:

Orders: Contains order details such as date, quantity, and product/property IDs.

Products: Includes product names, categories, and prices.

Properties: Lists the cities and states of the purchasing hotel properties.

After merging the datasets into a unified structure, several descriptive analyses were performed to understand purchasing behavior, product performance, and regional trends.

Key Insights:
Identified the top 10 products by both total sales revenue and quantity ordered.

Analyzed monthly sales trends to highlight seasonality and demand fluctuations.

Assessed regional demand by city and state to pinpoint high-volume locations.

Explored product category performance and price distribution using visualizations.

Calculated the average order size and flagged the most frequently reordered products.

Determined revenue contribution by product category to identify key drivers.

All visualizations were created using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, with a consistent and aesthetically appealing theme.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data manipulation, business insight generation, and data storytelling using Python.
